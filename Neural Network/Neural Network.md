# ANN-
* Artificial Neural Network, or ANN, is a group of multiple perceptrons/ neurons at each layer. 
* ANN is also known as a Feed-Forward Neural network because inputs are processed only in the forward direction
* ANN consists of 3 layers â€“ Input, Hidden and Output. The input layer accepts the inputs, the hidden layer processes the inputs, and the output layer produces the result.
* Advantage: Activation functions introduce nonlinear properties to the network. This helps the network learn any complex relationship between input and output.
* Disadvantage: The gradient vanishes or explodes as it propagates backward which leads to vanishing and exploding gradient.
# CNN-
* Kernels are used to extract the relevant features from the input using the convolution operation.
* Convolving an image with filters results in a feature map.
* CNN learns the filters automatically without mentioning it explicitly.
* CNN captures the spatial features from an image.
* Advantage: CNN also follows the concept of parameter sharing. A single filter is applied across different parts of an input to produce a feature map.
* Disadvantage: Overfitting, exploding gradient, and class imbalance are the major challenges while training the model using CNN.
