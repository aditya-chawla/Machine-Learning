# Decision Tree
* Decision Tree Classifier is a supervised learning algorithm
* It is a distribution-free or non-parametric method, which does not depend upon probability distribution assumptions.
## There are several different different algorithm used to generate trees such as,
* ID3 - Uses information gain, to decide the partition feature,not designed to deal with continuous features
* CART (Classification and regression trees) - Uses Gini coefficient to decide partition feature
* C4.5 - Works similar to ID3 by using information gain to split data. However C4.5 can handle continuous features, as well as can work with missing data
# Random Forest
* Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. 
* It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression.
* Random forests are created from subsets of data and the final output is based on average or majority ranking and hence the problem of overfitting is taken care of.
* Random forest randomly selects observations, builds a decision tree and the average result is taken. It doesnâ€™t use any set of formulas.
