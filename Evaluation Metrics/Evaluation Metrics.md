# RMSE-
* A metric that tells us how far apart the predicted values are from the observed values in a dataset, on average. 
* The lower the RMSE, the better a model fits a dataset.

* It is calculated as: RMSE = √Σ(Pi – Oi)2 / n
# R2 score-
* R2: A metric that tells us the proportion of the variance in the response variable of a regression model that can be explained by the predictor variables. This value ranges from 0 to 1. 
* The higher the R2 value, the better a model fits a dataset.
* It is calculated as: 
* R2 = 1 – (RSS/TSS)
where:
RSS represents the sum of squares of residuals
TSS represents the total sum of square

# RMSE VS. R2 score-
* The RMSE tells us how well a regression model can predict the value of the response variable in absolute terms while R2 tells us how well a model can predict the value of the response variable in percentage terms.
