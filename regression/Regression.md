# Linear Regression
* regression analysis uses an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input variables to the output variable 
(Y) i.e. Y = f(x) 
where Y is a continuous or real valued variable.

* Regression is said to be linear regression if the output dependent variable is a
linear function of the input variables.

## Simple Linear Regression (SLR)
* Simple linear regression is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable.
* It concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line)
that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variable.

## Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
* Multiple regression models describe how a single response variable Y depends linearly on a number of predictor variables.

### Regression models are not used for Classification because of following reasons:
1) Regression models give continuous values of output variable and does not give probabilistic values.
2) Linear Regression models are insensitive to imbalance data.

# Logistic Regression
* It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.
* Logistic regression uses the concept of predictive modeling as regression; therefore, it is called logistic regression
* Logistic Regression is much similar to the Linear Regression except that how they are used. Linear Regression is used for solving Regression problems, whereas Logistic regression is used for solving the classification problems
